## The Grammar

In PEG-format, the grammar can be specified as follows (also encoded in `phoron.peg`):

```


```

## How to run and test the grammar?

The grammar is written in [PEG](https://bford.info/pub/lang/peg/) format compatible with the [peg tool](https://www.piumarta.com/software/peg/peg.1.html).

To test the grammar, run the following command at the command line:

```
% sh test.sh
```

If everything passes, then the grammar is working as expected. You can add more test files (look at `AllInOne.pho` for all the features supported by Phoron, and to the 
[specification](../Specification.md) for the full specification of Phoron.
